# Web Development Learning Journey 🚀

Welcome to my 1-year web development learning repository! This is a comprehensive documentation of my journey from frontend to backend and DevOps.

## 📖 About This Repository

This repository serves as a living document of my web development learning experience. Over the course of one year, I'll be building projects, writing code, and documenting my progress as I master the essential skills needed to become a full-stack developer with DevOps knowledge.

## 🎯 Learning Objectives

- Master **Frontend Development** (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and modern frameworks)
- Build expertise in **Backend Development** (Server-side languages, APIs, and databases)
- Understand **DevOps** practices (CI/CD, containerization, cloud platforms)
- Create real-world projects to solidify concepts
- Build a strong portfolio showcasing my skills
